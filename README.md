# 2. Explanation of Pusher Integration
How Real-Time Updates Work
When a new product is fetched/added:

The ProductController triggers the ProductUpdated event.

Laravel broadcasts this event to Pusher.

Pusher relays the event to all connected clients:

The frontend (products.blade.php) listens using Pusher-JS.

When an update is detected, it dynamically refreshes the product list.

# Key Components
Component	Role
Pusher Channels	Handles real-time WebSocket communication
Laravel Events (ProductUpdated)	Broadcasts changes to Pusher
JavaScript (Pusher-JS)	Listens for updates and refreshes UI
